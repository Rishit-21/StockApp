# API References and Integration Points

This document outlines the external APIs used (and currently mocked) within the StockTrader application, and provides guidance on integrating real services.

## 1. Stock Market Data APIs

The application requires two types of stock market data: historical data and live (real-time or delayed) data.

### 1.1. Historical Stock Data

*   **Current Implementation**: Mocked
*   **Service**: `StockTrader.Service.Services.HistoricalDataService`
*   **Mock Logic**: The `GenerateMockHistoricalData` private method within `HistoricalDataService.cs`.
    *   Location: `StockTrader.Service/Services/HistoricalDataService.cs`
*   **Integration Point**: Inside the `FetchAndStoreHistoricalDataAsync` method in `HistoricalDataService.cs`, replace the call to `GenerateMockHistoricalData` with calls to a real financial data API.

*   **Potential Real APIs**:
    *   **Alpha Vantage**: Offers free and premium tiers for historical and live data. ([https://www.alphavantage.co/](https://www.alphavantage.co/))
    *   **IEX Cloud**: Provides financial data with various subscription levels. ([https://iexcloud.io/](https://iexcloud.io/))
    *   **Yahoo Finance API**: While not official, libraries exist to scrape Yahoo Finance. Use with caution regarding terms of service.
    *   **Commercial APIs**: Bloomberg, Reuters Eikon, FactSet (typically for enterprise use).
    *   **Broker-Specific APIs**: Zerodha Kite Connect, Upstox API (require user accounts and API key generation, often with specific client libraries).
        *   Zerodha Kite Connect: [https://kite.trade/](https://kite.trade/)
        *   Upstox API: [https://upstox.com/developer/](https://upstox.com/developer/)

*   **Considerations for Integration**:
    *   **API Keys**: Most APIs require registration and an API key. Store these securely (e.g., user secrets, environment variables, Azure Key Vault), not hardcoded.
    *   **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits. Implement retry logic and potentially caching.
    *   **Data Mapping**: Map the response from the external API to the `StockTrader.Core.Models.HistoricalPrice` model.
    *   **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for API request failures.

### 1.2. Live Market Data

*   **Current Implementation**: Mocked
*   **Service**: `StockTrader.Service.Services.LiveMarketDataService`
*   **Mock Logic**: The `GenerateMockLivePrice` private method within `LiveMarketDataService.cs`.
    *   Location: `StockTrader.Service/Services/LiveMarketDataService.cs`
*   **Integration Point**: Inside the `FetchAndStoreLiveMarketDataAsync` method in `LiveMarketDataService.cs`, replace the call to `GenerateMockLivePrice` with calls to a real live data API or a WebSocket stream.

*   **Potential Real APIs/Services**:
    *   The same APIs listed for historical data often provide live data endpoints (Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud).
    *   **Broker-Specific APIs**: Zerodha Kite Connect and Upstox API are particularly suited for live data, often providing streaming capabilities via WebSockets.
    *   **FinancialModelingPrep API**: Another option for real-time and historical data. ([https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/))

*   **Considerations for Integration**:
    *   **Polling vs. Streaming**: For true real-time data, WebSockets are preferred over polling HTTP endpoints due to efficiency and reduced latency.
    *   **Data Normalization**: Live data feeds can vary. Ensure consistent mapping to `StockTrader.Core.Models.LivePrice`.
    *   **Subscription Management**: If using WebSockets, manage symbol subscriptions and unsubscriptions effectively.

## 2. Sentiment Analysis

The application fetches and analyzes global sentiment from news and social media.

*   **Current Implementation**: Mocked
*   **Service**: `StockTrader.Service.Services.SentimentAnalysisService`
*   **Mock Logic**: The `GenerateMockSentimentData` private method within `SentimentAnalysisService.cs`.
    *   Location: `StockTrader.Service/Services/SentimentAnalysisService.cs`
*   **Integration Point**: Inside the `FetchAndStoreSentimentDataAsync` method in `SentimentAnalysisService.cs`, replace the call to `GenerateMockSentimentData` with calls to:
    1.  News data APIs to fetch articles/headlines.
    2.  Social media APIs (if available and permitted by terms of service).
    3.  An NLP service/library to perform sentiment analysis on the fetched text.

### 2.1. News Data APIs

*   **Potential Real APIs**:
    *   **NewsAPI.org**: Access to headlines and articles from various sources. ([https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/))
    *   **GNews API**: Another API for news articles. ([https://gnews.io/](https://gnews.io/))
    *   **Bing News Search API (Azure Cognitive Services)**: Provides news search capabilities.

### 2.2. Social Media APIs

*   **Twitter API**: Access to tweets. Requires developer account and adherence to strict usage policies. ([https://developer.twitter.com/](https://developer.twitter.com/))
*   **Reddit API**: Access to posts and comments. ([https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/))
*   *Note*: Access to social media data for large-scale analysis can be challenging due to API restrictions and terms of service.

### 2.3. NLP and Sentiment Analysis Services/Libraries

Once text data (news headlines, social media posts) is fetched, it needs to be analyzed for sentiment.

*   **Cloud-based NLP Services**:
    *   **Azure Cognitive Service for Language (Text Analytics)**: Offers sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, etc. ([https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/))
    *   **Google Cloud Natural Language API**: Provides sentiment analysis and other NLP features. ([https://cloud.google.com/natural-language](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language))
    *   **Amazon Comprehend**: AWS service for NLP tasks including sentiment analysis. ([https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/))
*   **.NET Libraries (for local processing)**:
    *   **ML.NET**: Microsoft's open-source ML framework, includes tools for sentiment analysis. ([https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet))
    *   **VaderSharp**: A .NET port of the VADER sentiment analysis tool, good for social media text.
    *   **Stanford CoreNLP**: Powerful Java-based NLP library, can be used with .NET via IKVM or interop.

*   **Integration Steps**:
    1.  Fetch text data from news/social media APIs.
    2.  For each piece of text, send it to the chosen NLP service/library.
    3.  Map the sentiment score (typically -1 to 1) and other relevant info to the `StockTrader.Core.Models.SentimentData` model.
    4.  Store the results.

## 3. AI/ML Model for Trading Tips

*   **Current Implementation**: Simplified rule-based logic.
*   **Service**: `StockTrader.Service.Services.TradingStrategyEngine`
*   **Logic Location**: Within the `GenerateTipsAsync` method in `TradingStrategyEngine.cs`.
    *   File: `StockTrader.Service/Services/TradingStrategyEngine.cs`
*   **Integration Point**: The section marked `// --- AI/ML Model Integration Point ---` in `GenerateTipsAsync`.
    *   Here, you would load a pre-trained ML model.
    *   Input features for the model would be derived from live price data, historical data, and sentiment scores.
    *   The model's output (e.g., buy/sell/hold probability, predicted price movement) would be translated into `TradingTip` objects.

*   **Considerations for ML Model Integration**:
    *   **Model Training**: A separate process/project would be needed for training the ML model using historical data, sentiment, and corresponding market outcomes. Libraries like scikit-learn (Python), TensorFlow, PyTorch, or ML.NET could be used.
    *   **Model Deployment**: The trained model needs to be saved in a format that can be loaded by the C# application (e.g., ONNX for ML.NET/TensorFlow models).
    *   **Feature Engineering**: Design relevant features from the available data to feed into the model.
    *   **Prediction Service**: You might create a dedicated service (e.g., `IMlModelService`) to encapsulate loading the model and making predictions.
